1. app/(app)

Purpose:
This folder contains the primary routes or pages for the application.
The name (app) indicates that it's a grouped route within Next.js.
Grouping is used for organizing routes without adding the group name to the URL path.
Contents:
Pages such as dashboard, layout.tsx, and page.tsx might reside here.
Example structure:
markdown
Copy code
app/
├── (app)/
    ├── dashboard/
    │   ├── page.tsx
    ├── layout.tsx
    ├── page.tsx



2. app/(auth)
Purpose:
This folder contains routes related to user authentication, such as sign-in, sign-up, or verification pages.
Similar to (app), this is likely a grouped route for managing auth-related pages without affecting the URL path.
Contents:
Pages like sign-in, sign-up, and verify.
Example structure:
r
Copy code
app/
├── (auth)/
    ├── sign-in/
    │   ├── page.tsx
    ├── sign-up/
    │   ├── page.tsx
    ├── verify/
    │   ├── page.tsx




3. app/u
Purpose:
Likely used for user-specific dynamic routes, where [username] indicates a dynamic segment in the route.
For example, visiting /u/johndoe would render the page.tsx file under u/[username].
Contents:
A folder [username] containing a page.tsx file that dynamically renders content based on the username in the URL.
Example structure:
css
Copy code
app/
├── u/
    ├── [username]/
        ├── page.tsx




4. src/context/AutoProvider
Purpose:
Likely a React Context Provider for managing global state or shared logic across the app.
The name AutoProvider suggests it might handle authentication, user state, or automated settings for the app.
Contents:
A file or folder exporting a React Context and Provider component.
Example usage:
tsx
Copy code
import { AutoProvider } from '@/context/AutoProvider';

function App() {
  return (
    <AutoProvider>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </AutoProvider>
  );
}




5. src/helpers
Purpose:
A utility directory for small reusable functions that provide specific, often stateless, functionality.
Examples include formatting dates, sanitizing inputs, or other common operations.
Contents:
Functions like formatDate.ts, capitalize.ts, or fetchHelper.ts.



6. src/hooks
Purpose:
Contains custom React hooks for reusable logic specific to your application.
Hooks encapsulate stateful logic or side effects that can be shared between components.
Contents:
Examples include:
useAuth: Handles authentication logic.
useToast: Manages toast notifications.
useFetch: Simplifies API calls.



7. src/lib
Purpose:
A collection of libraries, configurations, or helper functions that are core to your app's functionality.
It’s typically used for higher-level utilities that integrate with external APIs or libraries.
Contents:
Examples include:
API clients (e.g., Axios setup).
Utility functions (e.g., JWT validation or database connectors).
Third-party integrations (e.g., Stripe, Firebase).




8. types/next-auth.d.ts
Purpose:
A TypeScript declaration file for extending or customizing types used by NextAuth.js.
Allows you to define custom session types, user objects, and additional fields used in authentication.
Contents:
Custom type definitions, such as:
typescript
Copy code
import { DefaultSession } from "next-auth";

declare module "next-auth" {
  interface Session {
    user: {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      email: string;
      role: string;
    } & DefaultSession["user"];
  }
}
This ensures TypeScript understands the structure of your authentication data.
